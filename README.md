# *Emperical project on the AirBnb housing market*
### *What is the current state of the AirBnB housing market and are there some interesting trends coming up?*

### **Research Motivation**
Tilburg University would like not to only publish papers, but also the code that generated the results. That is very important for open science. The goal for this project is to create a proper structure, (e.g. a clear directory structure). Moreover the goals is to split up the ode from the R file into multiple and seperate R scripts. And last but not least to automate the workflow and make it reproducible using 'make'.
